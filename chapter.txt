you suffer more in imagination than reality.

Three rule in life:

if you do not go after what you want. You will never have it.
if you do not ask, the answer will be no.
if youdo not step forward, you will remain in the same place.

Never give up on something you really want. It's difficult to wait, but worse to regret.
